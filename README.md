# Performance Leaves

An addon that makes the leaves of Compbuild Textures blocky to reduce lag. Lower end PCs using Compbuild Pack trying to load areas with lots of trees may benefit off of this addon. Not just low ends but higher ends trying to load a lot of chunks for large screenshots may also benefit.

## How to install

**IMPORTANT:** Before you install the addon, install the main pack first. The main pack can be found at (https://github.com/CompbuildREDUX/Compbuild-Textures). The PBR effects also require shaders to work, be sure to use shaders as well. 

1. Install Compbuild Textures
2. Install the Performance Leaves Addon
3. Once you've installed the PL addon, put it in `AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks`
4. To enable the addon, place the addon over Compbuild Textures. An image is shown below.

**Installing the addon is very similar to installing the main pack, all you need to do is place the addon over the main pack.**
